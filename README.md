# HealthScore-Predictor
This project proposes a predictive data-driven framework to forecast restaurant health inspection scores and identify establishments at higher risk of violations using machine learning models using the San Francisco Health Inspection Scores (2024-current) dataset as a baseline

HYPOTHESIS
1. Restaurants with previous critical violations, lower Google ratings, or specific cuisine categories are more likely to score poorly in future inspections.
2. Machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Logistic Regression) can outperform traditional statistical baselines in predicting inspection outcomes.
3. Publicly available review data can serve as a proxy for hygiene perception and may correlate with actual inspection results.
